Project Overview

Microbes have immense impacts on plant nutrient uptake, growth promotion, and pathogen tolerance, and the role of host factors in microbiome assembly is of increasing interest in crop breeding.

In Rice Microbiome Project, we are interested in understanding the effects of host plant on the microbiome in rice (Oryza sativa) and other crop species. We use diverse techniques (16S rRNA sequencing, genomic resequencing, etc.) to explore the variation in both plant genetics and microbiomes aiming at deciphering plant-microbe interactions from a systemic view. 

# Sequencing data of 16S rRNA is available from the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) under the accession of CRA004426 (www.ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/).
